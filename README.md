# vs-codesandboxer

Open a react component from your editor into codesandboxer, using `codesandboxer-fs` under-the-hood.

Can be used with the command `Codesandboxer:deploy` or right click in your active file to select to deploy it. Once your needed files/dependencies have been sorted out, an 'open in codesandbox' link will open as a notification. Click it and you'll be able to see your component in codesandbox, and share it with others.

## Main use-cases

Sharing! When you want to get opinions on changes to a component but are not publishing built isolated version anywhere, you can open it here and share it more easily.

This can help teams that are working asynchronously/remotely share proposed changes easily and start getting feedback, outside heavier more robust git-based processes.

## Provisos

Currently this package has some limitations that codesandbox does not. We want to expand it later, but you should just be aware that:

1. We assume the target file exports a react component (we will definitely try and render it into a react tree). If you point it at a file that doesn't export a react component, it's going to fail.

2. We only support react, unlike codesandbox itself. Hopefully we will be expanding this to other templates soonish.
